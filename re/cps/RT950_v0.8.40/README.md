## About the project

RT-950/950Pro Editor is an alternative to the original Radtel CPS software. It provides a larger, easier-to-use interface for managing memory channels, zones, radio settings, APRS information, DTMF data, modulation memories, and other supported radio options.

The editor can work directly with the radio through a USB programming cable or Bluetooth Low Energy, and it can also open and save compatible Radtel CPS `.dat` files.

This project is independent community software and is not produced, sponsored, or supported by Radtel.

## Main features

- Read the radio through a USB/COM programming cable.
- Write edited data back to the radio with automatic backup and optional verification.
- Experimental Bluetooth/BLE reading and writing.
- Edit memory channels in a large spreadsheet-style table.
- View and edit channels by zone.
- Rename radio zones.
- Edit receive and transmit frequencies independently.
- Configure CTCSS and DCS tones.
- Set bandwidth, power, scan inclusion, scrambler, encryption, and other channel options.
- Enable or inhibit transmission on individual channels.
- Preserve AM modulation on supported non-airband frequencies.
- Edit VFO settings.
- Edit optional radio features.
- Edit DTMF codes.
- Edit FM, AM, and SSB modulation-memory data.
- Edit APRS settings, including callsign and supported beacon options.
- Import and export CSV channel lists.
- Open CHIRP-compatible CSV files as editable tabs.
- Import included stock configurations for common services and calling frequencies.
- Open, edit, and save compatible OEM `.dat` files.
- Upload a custom boot picture through the USB/COM cable.
- Light and dark interface themes.
- Multilingual application shell.
- Built-in automatic and manual update checking.
- Persistent rotating diagnostic logs for startup, update detection, network failures, and unexpected application and worker-thread errors.
- **Help > Open Log Folder** for quickly locating support logs and write transcripts.

## RadioRef Import

Choose **File > RadioRef Import** to search public RadioReference frequency listings without an API key. The integrated window supports:

- ZIP-code lookup with automatic city, county, and state resolution.
- City and state searches.
- County and state searches using a bundled county-ID cache.
- Mode filters for FM/analog, AM, digital, DMR, P25, NXDN, D-STAR, and C4FM.
- A preview table where you can select specific rows.
- Direct import into the currently open file, with zone, append/overwrite, and start-channel controls.
- CHIRP-compatible CSV export and human-readable TXT export.
- CHIRP CSV validation, filtering, CSV-to-TXT conversion, and county-cache refresh tools.
- Generation of all 22 standard GMRS/FRS channels and all 7 NOAA Weather Radio channels.

RadioRef results default to **receive-only**. The RT-950/950Pro can store digital-system frequencies for monitoring, but it cannot decode DMR, P25, NXDN, D-STAR, or C4FM audio. Website layout changes can temporarily affect scraping. Use the feature responsibly and follow the website's terms and applicable radio regulations.

## RepeaterBook Import

Choose **File > RepeaterBook Import** to perform a user-triggered RepeaterBook search and import selected repeaters directly into the configuration currently open in the editor.

RepeaterBook requires every user of a distributed desktop application to generate a personal app-bound token. The token begins with `rbuapp_`. Open the token-management link inside the importer, sign in to RepeaterBook, select **RT-950/950Pro Editor**, generate the token, and paste the complete value into the application. A shared `app_` token is not accepted or included with the program.

The importer supports:

- United States ZIP-code resolution to city and state.
- United States searches by state, city, county, callsign, frequency, landmark, mode, emergency-service classification, and Amateur/GMRS service.
- Rest-of-world searches by country, region, city, callsign, frequency, landmark, and mode.
- Analog, DMR, NXDN, P25, and TETRA filters supported by the documented API.
- Operational-only filtering and selectable result limits.
- A preview table with multi-row selection.
- Direct import into the active file with destination zone, append/overwrite, and starting-channel controls.
- Duplicate RX/TX detection.
- Receive-only import or omission of digital-only repeaters that the RT-950/950Pro cannot decode.
- Receive-only safety handling when a repeater result does not provide an input frequency.
- RepeaterBook attribution and links to the source site and individual repeater details when IDs are available.

On Windows, remembered tokens are protected with Windows Data Protection and can be read only by the same Windows user account. The token is sent only in the `X-RB-App-Token` request header; it is not placed in the URL or application logs. RepeaterBook requests are made only when the user clicks Search.

RepeaterBook data is for the user's personal radio-programming workflow. Review frequencies, offsets, tones, access restrictions, operating status, and transmit authorization before writing the radio. **Data courtesy of RepeaterBook.com.**

## Supported workflows

### Direct USB/COM programming

The recommended and most thoroughly tested method is a compatible USB programming cable that appears in Windows as a COM port.

The editor uses the recovered factory CPS communication protocol to:

1. Identify the connected radio.
2. Read the radio into a new editor tab.
3. Create a fresh pre-write backup.
4. Build a complete write image from the edited data.
5. Write the data to the radio.
6. Optionally read the radio back and verify the result.

### Bluetooth/BLE programming

Bluetooth/BLE read and write support is available for compatible RT-950/950Pro radios.

BLE writing uses the stable full-payload method. Because wireless programming can be interrupted by range, battery, or operating-system Bluetooth behavior, keep the radio close to the computer and do not power it off during a write.

Experimental BLE boot-picture upload is disabled.

### OEM `.dat` file editing

The editor can open and save compatible Radtel CPS `.dat` files. This is useful when you want to:

- Prepare a codeplug without connecting a radio.
- Exchange data with the OEM CPS.
- Keep dated configuration backups.
- Edit channel and settings data before writing with either application.

Legacy `.dat` channel records are automatically upgraded in memory when newer fields are required.

### CSV import and export

CSV support makes it easier to create, review, and exchange channel lists in spreadsheet applications.

Included templates are available in the `templates` folder:

- `rt950_channels_template.csv`
- `rt950_modulation_template.csv`
- `rt950_zones_template.csv`
- `rt950_csv_template_field_guide.txt`

The project also includes stock configuration CSV files for services and calling frequencies in several countries. Always verify local laws and frequency assignments before transmitting.

## System requirements

### To run the released application

- Windows 10 or Windows 11 recommended.
- A Radtel RT-950 or RT-950Pro radio.
- A compatible USB programming cable for COM/USB programming, or a Bluetooth-capable PC for BLE programming.
- The correct USB serial driver for the cable. Many cables use a CH340-compatible driver.

End users running the released `.exe` do not need Python.

### To run from source or build the executable

- Python 3.
- Packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
- Build packages listed in `requirements-build.txt`.
- PyInstaller for creating the portable Windows executable.

The repository includes Windows build scripts:

- `INSTALL_PYTHON_FOR_BUILD_WINDOWS.bat`
- `BUILD_CLEAN_PORTABLE_WINDOWS.bat`
- `MAKE_RELEASE_ZIP_WINDOWS.bat`

## Installation

1. Open the repository's **Releases** page.
2. Download the newest `RT950_vX.X.XX.zip` release.
3. Extract the entire ZIP file to a normal folder.
4. Run:

```text
RT-950_950Pro_Editor.exe
```

Do not run the executable directly from inside the ZIP archive.

Windows Defender or another antivirus program may warn about an unsigned community-built executable. Download releases only from the official project repository. See `DEFENDER_FALSE_POSITIVE_NOTES.md` and `docs/ANTIVIRUS_FALSE_POSITIVES.md` for more information.

## Quick start: read, edit, and write a radio

### 1. Connect the radio

1. Connect the programming cable to the radio and computer.
2. Turn the radio on.
3. Close the OEM Radtel CPS, CHIRP, serial terminals, and any other application that may be using the COM port.
4. In the editor, open **COM Port Connection** or choose **Radio > COM Port Settings**.
5. Select the radio's real COM port, such as `COM3` or `COM5`.

You can find the assigned port in Windows Device Manager under **Ports (COM & LPT)**.

### 2. Read the radio

Choose:

```text
Radio > Read Radio
```

The editor reads the radio and opens the result in a new tab. Keep the automatic backup created by the application.

### 3. Edit the configuration

Use the left navigation or the **Edit** menu to open the section you need:

- Memory Channels
- VFO Mode
- Optional Features
- DTMF Codes
- FM/AM/SSB Modulation
- Zones
- APRS Info
- Encryption Presets

For channel editing, select one or more rows and change the required fields. Review receive frequency, transmit frequency, tones, modulation, bandwidth, power, and TX Enable before writing.

### 4. Write the radio

Choose:

```text
Radio > Write Radio
```

For normal use, leave both of these options enabled:

- Create/read a fresh backup before writing.
- Verify the radio after writing.

Do not disconnect the cable, close the program, or power off the radio during a write.

## Bluetooth/BLE use

1. Turn on Bluetooth on the Windows computer.
2. Enable Bluetooth on the radio.
3. Disconnect the radio from the Radtel phone application so the radio can advertise.
4. Open **Read Radio** or **Write Radio**.
5. Choose **Bluetooth / BLE**.
6. Click **Scan BLE**.
7. Select the detected radio.
8. Start the read or write operation.

Keep a known-good backup and keep the radio near the computer throughout the operation.

## Working with stock configurations

The `stock_configs` folder contains prepared CSV lists for common services and frequency groups. To use one:

1. Open **File > Open Stock Config**.
2. Select the desired configuration.
3. Choose the destination zone or import behavior when prompted.
4. Review every imported channel before writing.

Stock lists are provided as a convenience. Frequencies, channel plans, licensing requirements, and transmit permissions can change and may differ by location.

## TX Enable and receive-only channels

The **TX Enable** field controls the radio's per-channel transmit-enable flag.

- Set **TX Enable** to ON for channels where transmission is intended and permitted.
- Set **TX Enable** to OFF for receive-only channels.
- Leaving the transmit-frequency field blank is also appropriate for many receive-only configurations.

After writing important receive-only channels, use verification or read the radio again to confirm the setting remained disabled. When testing, use a suitable 50-ohm dummy load and test equipment rather than transmitting over the air.

## AM channel support

AM can be selected on supported memory channels, including supported frequencies outside the normal aviation band. Version v0.8.35 and later preserve the AM flag when building the radio upload image.

The radio's actual receive capabilities still depend on its firmware and hardware.

## Custom boot picture

COM/USB boot-picture upload is supported.

1. Connect the radio through the real programming-cable COM port.
2. Open **Tools > Boot Picture**.
3. Load an image from the computer.
4. Adjust or preview it as needed.
5. Start the upload.
6. Wait until all 150 image pages have been acknowledged.
7. Power-cycle the radio to display the new boot image.

The factory-compatible completion sequence sends the final `Over` frame without expecting another response from the radio. A successful upload is determined by acknowledgment of all 150 image pages.

Boot-image readback is not enabled because tested radio firmware did not reliably return the existing image.

## Backups and recovery

The editor performs a fresh radio read before normal writes and stores backup captures in the application-data folder.

Typical location:

```text
C:\Users\<your-name>\AppData\Roaming\RT950ProEditor
```

Recommended backup routine:

1. Read and save the original radio configuration before making changes.
2. Keep at least one known-good OEM CPS `.dat` file.
3. Keep the editor's automatic pre-write captures.
4. Export important channel lists to CSV.
5. After a successful write and verification, keep a dated copy as a recovery point.

Do not publicly upload private codeplugs that contain personal callsigns, APRS coordinates, private frequencies, names, or other sensitive information.

## Troubleshooting

### The COM port is missing

- Reconnect the USB cable.
- Check Windows Device Manager under **Ports (COM & LPT)**.
- Install the correct USB serial driver.
- Close any other software using the port.
- Try another USB port.

### Radio read fails

- Confirm that the radio is powered on.
- Confirm that the correct COM port is selected.
- Close the OEM CPS and other serial applications.
- Reconnect the cable and power-cycle the radio.

### Radio write fails

- Do not immediately disconnect the radio.
- Save the displayed log.
- Power-cycle the radio and try reading it again.
- Restore a known-good backup when necessary.

### Verify reports differences

- Read the radio again and inspect the affected fields.
- Confirm that the radio firmware supports the edited option.
- Restore the pre-write backup if the result is incorrect.

### Boot picture does not appear

Power the radio completely off and back on after the upload.

### Antivirus warning

Unsigned PyInstaller applications can trigger reputation-based or heuristic antivirus warnings. Download only from the official repository and review the included antivirus documentation.

## Diagnostic logs and bug reports

The editor keeps a rotating application log in:

```text
C:\Users\<your-name>\AppData\Roaming\RT950ProEditor\logs
```

Use **Help > Open Log Folder** to open this location. The current file is named `rt950pro_editor.log`; older rotated copies may be named `rt950pro_editor.log.1`, `.2`, and so on.

**Help > Enable Detailed Logging** is enabled by default. It records extra update-check details such as the GitHub endpoint, HTTP result, response source, parsed remote version, version-comparison keys, selected release asset, and final update decision. Disabling detailed logging reduces the log to INFO/error entries, but update failures and unexpected errors are still recorded.

Personal RepeaterBook `rbuapp_` tokens and legacy shared `app_` tokens are automatically redacted from application log messages. Still review any file before posting it publicly because codeplugs, screenshots, and third-party error text may contain other personal information.

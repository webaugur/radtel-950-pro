# RT-950/950Pro Editor User Guide

## Run the app

Open the released Windows executable:

```text
RT-950_950Pro_Editor.exe
```

End users do not need Python or any build tools.

## Connect the radio

1. Connect the programming cable.
2. Turn the radio on.
3. Open **COM Port Connection** or **Radio > COM Port Settings**.
4. Select the COM port, such as `COM3` or `COM5`.

## Read the radio

Use **Radio > Read Radio**. The app reads the radio and opens the result as a tab. Keep the backup the app creates before editing or writing.

## Edit channels

Use **Memory Channels** to edit all channels or use the channel view selector to edit channels by zone.

You can select multiple channels with the checkbox column and use bulk edit to apply the same change to all selected channels.

## Write the radio

Use **Radio > Write Radio**. Leave backup enabled unless you have a specific reason not to. Use verify after write when you want the app to read back and compare the radio after writing.

## Dark mode

Use **View > Dark mode** or the sidebar theme button. The app remembers your theme choice.

## Important

Verify all frequencies, tones, offsets, and legal transmit permissions before writing data to the radio.

## Bluetooth/BLE read and write

Version v0.8.0 added experimental Bluetooth/BLE read and write. Version v0.8.1 adds visible attribution for the BLE reference work. In **Read Radio** or **Write Radio**, choose **Bluetooth / BLE**, click **Scan BLE**, select the RT-950/950Pro radio, and then read or write.

Before scanning, turn on Bluetooth on the PC, enable Bluetooth on the radio, and disconnect the radio from the phone app so it is advertising.

Bluetooth write is experimental. Keep a known-good backup, keep the radio powered on, and do not interrupt the write.

## RepeaterBook import

Use **File > RepeaterBook Import** to search with a personal RepeaterBook `rbuapp_` token and import selected repeaters directly into the open configuration. Choose the destination zone and append or overwrite behavior, then review every imported frequency, input, tone, mode, and TX-enable setting before writing. See `REPEATERBOOK_IMPORT.md` for token setup and troubleshooting.
